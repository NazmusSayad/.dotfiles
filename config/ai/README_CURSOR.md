## Files

- If no file is specified, prioritize the currently opened file.
- Modify existing files only. Do not create new files or directories unless instructed.

## Code Style and Best Practices

- Keep code minimal, direct, and readable.
- Do not add comments unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not use hacks, workarounds, magic values, or undocumented behavior.
- Implement logic in the most straightforward, explicit way supported by the language or framework.

### Avoid Abstractions and Over-Declaration

- Prefer direct, inline implementations.
- Introduce helpers, extra variables, or abstractions only when they remove meaningful duplication.

### TypeScript Rules

- Rely on type inference whenever possible.
- Do not use `any`, casts, or explicit generic type arguments when inference is sufficient.

## Important Skills

- Must use `npm` skill to: run, execute, install, update, remove npm packages

## CLI/Terminal

- Run terminal commands only when instructed.
