# Files

- If no file is specified, prioritize the currently opened file.
- Modify existing files only. Do not create new files or directories unless instructed.

# Code Style and Best Practices

- Keep code minimal, direct, and readable.
- Do not add comments unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not use hacks, workarounds, magic values, or undocumented behaviors.
- Implement logic in the most straightforward, explicit way supported by the language or framework.

## Avoid Abstractions and Over Declarations

- Prefer the most direct, inline implementation.
- Add helpers, extra variables, or abstractions only when they reduce meaningful duplication.

## TypeScript Rules

- Rely on full type inference when possible.
- Do not use type `any`, casts, or explicit generic type arguments when inference is possible.

# CLI/Terminal

- Run terminal commands only when instructed.
