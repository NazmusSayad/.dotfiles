# Summarize the Problem

Explain the actual problem we were trying to solve.

### Ignore everything related to:

– code you wrote
– designs you proposed
– steps you took
– partial solutions
– experiments, refactors, or workarounds

Do not describe what you did.
Do not justify how you approached it.
Do not reference implementation details, tools, or architecture unless they are intrinsic to the problem itself.

### Focus strictly on:

– what was broken or insufficient
– why this issue exists at a fundamental level
– what a correct solution must achieve to be considered “fixed”
– what was intentionally out of scope
– constraints that cannot be changed
– uncertainties that still matter

Explain this clearly and concisely, as if the implementation has been completely discarded and only the problem remains.

## Guidelines

- Do not include headers or any other text. Do not say "The problem is..." or "The issue is..." or anything like that. Just the problem itself.
