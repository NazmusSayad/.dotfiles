## Code Style and Best Practices

- Keep code minimal, direct, and readable.
- Do not add comments unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not use hacks, workarounds, magic values, or undocumented behaviors.
- Implement logic in the most straightforward, explicit way supported by the language or framework.

### Avoid Abstractions and Over Declarations

- Prefer the most direct, inline implementation.
- Add helpers, extra variables, or abstractions only when they reduce meaningful duplication.

### TypeScript Rules

- Rely on full type inference when possible.
- Do not use type `any`, casts, or explicit generic type arguments when inference is possible.

## Must Use Skills

- Always use `npm` skill to run npm scripts, install, update, remove, and manage npm packages.
